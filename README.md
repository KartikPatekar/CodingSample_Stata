Stata coding sample for comparing RTE vs non-RTE schools quality

The code sample file is: "KP_CodingSample.do"
Description: This code calcualtes School Value Index of schools in Chhattisgarh. SVI is constructed as a measure of Quality of schools using a regression of schools fees over school facilities (with village fixed effects). SVI is then used to compare public and private schools, enabling us to see the relation between school quality and RTE application rates. More details about SVI construction and it's significance can be found in Introduction and Section 3.1 of the paper "KP_Writing_Sample.pdf" 

Data Privacy: The study uses the RTE application data (aggregate values only). Since, this data cannot be shared publically, this sample code uses fake data (has random values). This sample also uses population census data and school facilities data. The population census data is freely available at https://www.devdatalab.org/shrug_download/ thanks to the Data Development Lab, while the school facilities data was scraped from publically available website https://src.udiseplus.gov.in/locateSchool/schoolSearch.
